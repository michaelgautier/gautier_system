/*
        Core mechanism for RSS.
                You need RSS feeds first.
                The feed is the location on the Internet where the feed articles reside.
                In this process, this "feed name cycle" + "feed name file manager" is the starting point for the entire process.
                
                Use get_feed_names to start the process.
                
                Use get_single_feed_name as a means to refresh feed information after a process has started.
